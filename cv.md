Contact info: Telegram, Github.
I'm really passionate with programming. Since my first thought about being a software engineer till now i can't spend my day without coding. I think that in the future i'll create something really helpfull for people!

SKILLS
My beginner skills: HTML, CSS, GIT and a little bit JS. As it's only the beginning of my career, I've got not lots of skills, but practice makes perfect and I believe that we can always find the solution in the internet if we are stuck.

Experience:
With the help of some tutorials i've made a website about movies and one simple funny webgame about a duck.

Education
Now i study at the Rolling Scopes School, I've complited 3 courses on codecademy.com: HTML, GIT, The Command Line and starting the 4th (CSS). I tried some courses on pluralsight, coursera and htmlacademy. I also attended a master-class where i created my first webgame.

English
I think my English is intermediate, at least most of the tests say so. I studied at BSU Lyceum, where we practiced English every day, had a lot of debates and public presentations. I also used to have some pen-friends and now once a week i visit an English speacking club.
